# Mutation Mode for [Sid Meier's Civilization VI](https://civilization.com/)

This repository is for maintaining mods series Mutation Mode. These are mods that change rules of Civ 6 in either minor or major ways (and usually random/chaotic) for fun changes.

## Mutation Mode: Civilizations and Leaders Abilities

This mode changes the default **Abilities (Traits)** of the game. You can [download from Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1742519440).

By default, without doing anything, the mod will assign random abilities for your Leader and keep the Civilization's abilities.

You can achieve better random or manually assign abilities by using the following app:
